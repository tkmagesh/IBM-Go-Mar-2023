Paradox of Choice (Barry Schwartz)
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM

Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
        - No access modifiers
        - No classes (only structs)
        - No inheritence (only composition)
        - No reference types (everything is a value)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No "try catch finally"
        - No pointer arithmetic
        - No implicit type conversion
        - No function overloading
        - No operator overloading

    2. Lightweight
        - Close to hardware
        - No VM
        - Tooling support for cross compilation
        - Performance is equivalent to C++

    3. Concurrency
        - Lightweight Concurrency Model (Goroutines)
            Linux OS Thread - 2MB
            Goroutine - 4KB
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            go keyword, channel data type, channel operator ( <- ), select case, range
        - APIs
            sync package
            sync/atomic package
